2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I kept working on this project for a few more hours I would try to learn how to implement the remaining optional features. At the moment I donâ€™t know how to add pictures or custom sounds to a application like this and I am unsure of where to find the information to learn this. With enough time I am sure I could figure it out however. Otherwise any other time I spent would be to simply fine tune the project as a whole. This includes looking to see if the code could be cleaned up, if its runtime could be optimized, ect.
